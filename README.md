# Feature-Selection-and-Cross-Validation-Assigment
This repository contains Python scripts that analyze the effects of different techniques on the performance of machine learning models for regression and classification tasks using four datasets. The analysis focuses on evaluating the impact of cross-validation and feature selection methods, including filter, wrapper, and PCA.

Cross-Validation vs. No Cross-Validation:

Two Python scripts compare the performance of machine learning models with and without cross-validation on two regression and two classification datasets.
The datasets include a wide range of features (~15+) to provide a representative analysis.
Interpretations are provided separately for each dataset, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-validation in improving model performance.

Feature Selection Methods Analysis:

Another Python script investigates the impact of filter, wrapper, and PCA feature selection techniques on model performance for regression and classification tasks.
The analysis is conducted on the same four datasets, allowing for a comprehensive comparison of different feature selection methods.
Interpretations are provided separately for each dataset, as well as combined insights for regression and classification tasks.
The repository serves as a valuable resource for understanding the effects of cross-validation and feature selection methods on machine learning model performance across different types of datasets, aiding in informed model selection and feature engineering decisions.
